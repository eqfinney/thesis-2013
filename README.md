## Using Radio Relics to Constrain the Dynamics of 1 RXS J0603.3+4214
Author: Emily Quinn Finney

A repository containing code and figures relevant to my 2013 Scripps College senior thesis. In this work, I constrained the collision angle of the merging galaxy cluster RX J0603.3+4214. Using radio data as a Bayesian prior, I determined how this angle affected predictions for its velocity and time since merger, constraining these parameters by 70-85%. The project culminated in a written thesis and a series of presentations, including an invited talk at Scripps College Capstone Day.

Most figures used in the thesis are created using code written by Will Dawson
